# RSA Timing Attack 

This code is an implementation of RSA encryption and decryption and to measure and analyze decryption timing to aid a side channel attack.

A python environment with the necessity packages installed is needed to run this code.

This project helps analyze the the time taken to decrypt the characters from the ciphertext.
With larger dataset it is also possible to find the key.

This image shows the analysis when the process is done N number of times,here we have limited to 100.
